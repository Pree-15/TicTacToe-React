## 📚 Description

The Tic-Tac-Toe application allows two users to play the classic 3x3 board game. The interface is clean, responsive, and easy to use. The game features automatic winner detection, turn switching, and board reset functionality.

React is used to build the UI in reusable components, while JavaScript controls the logic behind detecting win conditions, handling user clicks, updating the board, and resetting the game. CSS3 ensures the layout looks good across screens.
